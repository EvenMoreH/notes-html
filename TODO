Bug: remove_bad_metadata returns "" if no header â†’ converts to empty HTML. Should return original content.

<!-- Bug: generate_index_file may reference html_title / modified when they don't exist (unbound variable). Also sorting list_of_html_notes.sort() sorts HTML strings; better to build structured list and sort by title or date. -->

Bug: remove_unnecessary_html_files uses symmetric difference (^) which can remove files unexpectedly. Use set difference: html_files - md_files.

Style/API: directory_exists creates directories but name implies only check; rename to ensure_directories or create_directories.

Robustness: use file.suffix.lower() to handle .MD; use Path.open consistently (avoid mixing open()).

Performance: creating a new markdown.Markdown instance per file is okay but simpler to call markdown.markdown(...) or reuse and call reset().

Minor: add type hints, small docstrings, basic logging, and small defensive checks.
